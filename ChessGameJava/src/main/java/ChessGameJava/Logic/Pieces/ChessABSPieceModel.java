/**
 * Abstract class from which all pieces inherit from. This class keeps track of
 * the hasMoved attribute and colour attribute. 
 * 
 * This class can check for all the squares a piece is attacking and all the moves
 * a piece can currently do. It also provides a few sugarcoat functions to help in 
 * development such as a getter for the colour. 
 * 
 * We believe that all pieces should be self contained in their implementation. This 
 * means that a pieces movements should not depend on the implementation of an other 
 * piece. This is also why the pieces must verify themselves if a move is to them legal
 * as it promotes a more self contained and maintainable code.
