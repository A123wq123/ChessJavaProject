/**
 * This class describes a basic move for the pawn. This class functions almost entirely the same way a
 * BasicMove would but it checks if we did a double move for the pawn. We define a double move 
 * on a pawn as the possible first move when a pawn may move two squares forward and only on it's
 * first move. 
 * 
 * If this was the case, we update internally to the pawn the turn it did this double move from 
 * the current turn recorded by the board in ChessABSMove. This is useful for the implementation
 * of the en-passant mechanic described in the EnPassant move. 
 * 
 * If you decide to override this behavior to add more possible moves to the pawn, make sure to take 
 * in account the en-passant move.
