/**
 * Abstract class that describes the functions every move should follow. Notably, the functions to execute a move and revert
 * a move from the board. In theory, the state of the board before the execution of the processExecuteMove method should be the same
 * after we call processRevertMove to avoid any unintended side effects when verifying possible moves. 
 * 
 * This class is NOT in charge of verifying if a move is valid, this check is left to the implementation of the pieces. 
 * Child classes should only provide a way to execute or revert a move. 
 * 
 * This class also keeps track internally for every game and what move count we are and uses this to determine if some moves have 
 * not been reverted or executed before the current move. The idea being that if we create a move on a board in state A and then 
 * create a second move on that same state but execute it. The board is not in state B and the initially created move may no longer 
 * be valid.
